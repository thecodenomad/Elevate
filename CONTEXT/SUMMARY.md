# Project Summary
Elevate is a desktop application for inducing mental states (e.g., Sleep, Focus) through audio (binaural beats) and visual stimuli. It targets Linux users with a modern, adaptive GNOME interface using GTK4 and Libadwaita. Key features include state induction controls, customizable audio/visual stimuli, user settings, and an epilepsy warning dialog. The app is packaged as a Flatpak for distribution.

The application is built with Python 3.12, GTK4 4.12, Libadwaita 1.6, and uses Poetry for dependency management. It follows the GNOME Builder Python project template and is designed to be mobile-friendly with a sidebar for controls and a GL-based rendering area for visual stimuli.

The core functionality is implemented through:
- AudioStimulus: Generates binaural beats using GStreamer
- VisualStimulus: Renders visual stimuli (colors, breathing patterns) using Cairo
- StateInductionController: Coordinates audio and visual stimuli playback
- ElevateSettings: Manages user preferences using GSettings
- UI components: Built with Blueprint templates and GTK4/Libadwaita widgets
